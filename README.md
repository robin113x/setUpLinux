This README contains setup instructions and custom commands/aliases for a Linux environment.

## Git Remote Configuration

To set the Git remote URL with your GitHub personal access token (PAT), use the following command:

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://abcin113x:ghp_zo3gbffdbdfc@github.com/robin113x/WebSec.git
Warning: Be cautious with exposing your token publicly, as it's a security risk.

Custom Aliases
Here are some custom aliases and commands for commonly used tasks:

Change to Cobalt directory:

bash
Copy code
cs='/opt/cobalt'
Enable color output for diff commands:

bash
Copy code
diff='diff --color=auto'
egrep='egrep --color=auto'
fgrep='fgrep --color=auto'
grep='grep --color=auto'
Display the command history:

bash
Copy code
history='history 0'
Navigate to HTB directory:

bash
Copy code
htb='/home/robin/Documents/HTB'
Start VPN using OpenVPN:

bash
Copy code
hvpn='sudo openvpn /home/robin/Documents/HTB/HTB.ovpn'
Show IP with color:

bash
Copy code
ip='ip --color=auto'
Commonly used commands with shortcuts:

bash
Copy code
ipa=ipa.sh
l='ls -CF'
la='ls -A'
ll='ls -l'
ls='ls --color=auto'
Navigate to /opt/ directory:

bash
Copy code
opt='cd /opt/'
Use Python 3:

bash
Copy code
py=python3
python=python3
Use Neovim instead of Vim:

bash
Copy code
vi=nvim
vim=nvim
Which command (use whence instead of which):

bash
Copy code
which-command=whence
Mount Disk
To mount a disk at a specific location, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media/sunita/
Note: Make sure to modify the above configurations and commands as per your requirements. Be careful when sharing sensitive data, such as tokens, in public repositories.

### **Explanation:**

1. **Headings**: Use `#` for the main title, `##` for subheadings, and so on.
2. **Code Blocks**: Use triple backticks (```) to format code blocks. If you want to specify the language for syntax highlighting (like `bash`), you can add it directly after the first set of backticks.
3. **Inline Code**: Use single backticks (`) for inline code, like `git remote set-url`.
4. **Blockquotes**: Use `>` for blockquotes, like the security warning.
5. **Lists**: Use `-` or `*` for unordered lists.

### **Final Notes:**
- This format allows you to cleanly document your setup instructions and commands in a `README.md` file.
- Remember to replace any sensitive information (like your GitHub token) before sharing or publishing the file.

This README contains setup instructions, custom commands, and aliases for configuring a Linux environment.

## Git Remote Configuration

To set the Git remote URL with your GitHub personal access token (PAT), use the following command:

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://abcin113x:ghp_zo3gbffdbdfc@github.com/robin113x/WebSec.git
Warning: Be cautious with exposing your token publicly, as it's a security risk. Consider regenerating the token if it has been shared publicly.

bash
Copy code
sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media/sunita/
Note: Make sure to modify the above configurations and commands as per your requirements. Be careful when sharing sensitive data, such as tokens, in public repositories. Always regenerate tokens if they are exposed accidentally.

### **Explanation of Changes and Structure:**

1. **Headings**: The main title is created with `# setUpLinux`. Subsections are created with `##`, such as "Git Remote Configuration" and "Custom Aliases".
2. **Code Blocks**: All commands and aliases are enclosed in triple backticks (```), which allows them to be displayed in a formatted block.
3. **Blockquotes**: The `> **Warning**` section uses a blockquote to emphasize the security risk of exposing your personal access token.
4. **Lists**: The aliases and commands are listed using `-` to ensure clear separation of each item.

---

### **Best Practices:**

- **Security**: Be sure to **regenerate** your personal access token if itâ€™s been exposed publicly. Never share tokens in public repositories.
- **Customization**: You can modify the aliases or commands based on your needs. This file is a starting point for easy environment setup.
